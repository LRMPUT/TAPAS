Meaning of DOP Values

DOP 	Value		Rating	Description
<1		Ideal		This is the highest possible confidence level to be used for applications demanding the highest possible precision at all times.
1-2		Excellent	At this confidence level, positional measurements are considered accurate enough to meet all but the most sensitive applications.
2-5		Good		Represents a level that marks the minimum appropriate for making business decisions. Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user.
5-10	Moderate	Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended.
10-20	Fair		Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location.
>20		Poor		At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as 300 meters with a 6 meter accurate device (50 DOP Ã— 6 meters) and should be discarded.

The DOP values can be used to improve working of positioning filters given the uncertaintity of signal.
